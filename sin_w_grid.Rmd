This is pretty experimental work.  The python "parser" (basically no parsing) means there are strong constraints on code.  Each new line must yield complete code statement...  


```{r setup, include = F}
# This is the recommended set up for flipbooks
# you might think about setting cache to TRUE as you gain practice --- building flipbooks from scratch can be time consuming
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, 
                      comment = "", cache = T, fig.retina = 3, eval = F, dev = "jpg")
library(flipbookr)
library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)
```

`r chunk_reveal("numpy", lang = "python")`


```{python numpy, include = F}
# import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
t = np.arange(0, 2, .05)
t
s = np.sin(2*np.pi*t)
s
```


---

`r chunk_reveal("numpy2", lang = "python")`


```{python numpy2, include = F}
plt.plot(t, s)
plt.xlabel('time (s)')
plt.ylabel('voltage (mV)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```




```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 100%}

@media print {
  .has-continuation {
    display: block;
  }
}
```
