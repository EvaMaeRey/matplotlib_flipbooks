This is pretty experimental work.  The python "parser" (basically no parsing) means there are strong constraints on code.  Each new line must yield complete code statement...  


```{r setup, include = F}
# This is the recommended set up for flipbooks
# you might think about setting cache to TRUE as you gain practice --- building flipbooks from scratch can be time consuming
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, 
                      comment = "", cache = T, fig.retina = 3, eval = F, dev = "jpg")
library(flipbookr)
library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)
```

`r chunk_reveal("simple_plot", lang = "python", widths = c(40,59))`


```{python simple_plot, include = F}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
year = [1950, 1970, 
  1990, 2010]
pop = [2.519, 3, 5, 6]
plt.plot(year, pop)
plt.show()
```






```{css, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
.remark-code{line-height: 1.5; font-size: 100%}

@media print {
  .has-continuation {
    display: block;
  }
}
```
